## Demo Project
If you want to run the demo project you first need to run `pod install` to install the dependencies of RMDateSelectionViewController.

## Installation (CocoaPods)
```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod "RMDateSelectionViewController", "~> 2.0.3"
```

## Usage
### Basic
1. Import `RMDateSelectionViewController.h` in your view controller
	
	```objc
	#import "RMDateSelectionViewController.h"
	```
2. Create a date selection view controller, set select and cancel block and present the view controller
	
	```objc
	- (IBAction)openDateSelectionController:(id)sender {
		//Create select action
	    RMAction *selectAction = [RMAction actionWithTitle:@"Select" style:RMActionStyleDone andHandler:^(RMActionController *controller) {
	        NSLog(@"Successfully selected date: %@", ((UIDatePicker *)controller.contentView).date);
	    }];
	    
	    //Create cancel action
	    RMAction *cancelAction = [RMAction actionWithTitle:@"Cancel" style:RMActionStyleCancel andHandler:^(RMActionController *controller) {
	        NSLog(@"Date selection was canceled");
	    }];
	    
	    //Create date selection view controller
	    RMDateSelectionViewController *dateSelectionController = [RMDateSelectionViewController actionControllerWithStyle:style selectAction:selectAction andCancelAction:cancelAction];
	    dateSelectionController.title = @"Test";
	    dateSelectionController.message = @"This is a test message.\nPlease choose a date and press 'Select' or 'Cancel'.";
	    
	    //Now just present the date selection controller using the standard iOS presentation method
	    [self presentViewController:dateSelectionController animated:YES completion:nil];
	}
	```

### Advanced

#### Accessing the Date Picker
Every RMDateSelectionViewController has a property `datePicker`. With this property you have total control over the UIDatePicker that is shown on the screen.

#### Presentation Style
Additionally, you can use the property `modalPresentationStyle` to control how the date selection controller is shown. By default, it is set to `UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext`. But on the iPad you could use `UIModalPresentationPopover` to present the date selection controller within a popover. See the following example on how this works:

```objc
- (IBAction)openDateSelectionController:(id)sender {
	//Create select and cancel action
	...

	RMDateSelectionViewController *dateSelectionVC = [RMDateSelectionViewController actionControllerWithStyle:style selectAction:selectAction andCancelAction:cancelAction];

	//On the iPad we want to show the date selection view controller within a popover.
    if([UIDevice currentDevice].userInterfaceIdiom == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) {
        //First we set the modal presentation style to the popover style
        dateSelectionVC.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationPopover;
        
        //Then we tell the popover presentation controller, where the popover should appear
        dateSelectionVC.popoverPresentationController.sourceView = self.view;
        dateSelectionVC.popoverPresentationController.sourceRect = CGRectMake(...);
    }

	//Now just present the date selection controller using the standard iOS presentation method
	[self presentViewController:dateSelectionVC animated:YES completion:nil];
}
```

#### Adding Additional Buttons
You can add an arbitrary number of custom buttons to a RMDateSelectionViewController. Each button has it's own block that is executed when tapping the button. See the following example on how to add buttons.

```objc
- (IBAction)openDateSelectionController:(id)sender {
	//Create select action
    ...
    
    //Create date selection view controller
    RMDateSelectionViewController *dateSelectionController = [RMDateSelectionViewController actionControllerWithStyle:style selectAction:selectAction andCancelAction:cancelAction];
    
    //Create now action and add it to date selection view controller
    RMAction *nowAction = [RMAction actionWithTitle:@"Now" style:RMActionStyleAdditional andHandler:^(RMActionController *controller) {
        ((UIDatePicker *)controller.contentView).date = [NSDate date];
        NSLog(@"Now button tapped");
    }];
    nowAction.dismissesActionController = NO;
    
    [dateSelectionController addAction:nowAction];
    
    //Now just present the date selection controller using the standard iOS presentation method
    [self presentViewController:dateSelectionController animated:YES completion:nil];
}
```

#### Others
RMDateSelectionViewController does not use APIs that are only available for applications. Therefore, it can be used in both your main application and an action extension showing UI.

## Documentation
There is an additional documentation available provided by the CocoaPods team. Take a look at [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RMDateSelectionViewController/).

## Requirements

| Compile Time  | Runtime       |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| Xcode 7       | iOS 8         |
| iOS 9 SDK     |               |
| ARC           |               |

Note: ARC can be turned on and off on a per file basis.

Version 1.5.0 and above of RMDateSelectionViewController use custom transitions for presenting the date selection controller. Custom transitions are a new feature introduced by Apple in iOS 7. Unfortunately, custom transitions are totally broken in landscape mode on iOS 7. This issue has been fixed with iOS 8. So if your application supports landscape mode (even on iPad), version 1.5.0 and above of this control require iOS 8. Otherwise, iOS 7 should be fine. In particular, iOS 7 is fine for version 1.4.3 and below.

## Apps using this control
Using this control in your app or know anyone who does?

Feel free to add the app to this list: [Apps using RMDateSelectionViewController](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMDateSelectionViewController/wiki/Apps-using-RMDateSelectionViewController)

## Further Info
If you want to show an UIPickerView instead of an UIDatePicker, you may take a look at my other control called [RMPickerViewController](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMPickerViewController).

If you want to show any other control you may want to take a look at [RMActionController](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMActionController).
