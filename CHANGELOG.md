## [2.0.0] Next Release

This version is the current in development. Will be released after the week of *6th November 2019*.

### Added

- New Logger for Native Code. Makes easier to Spot Errors. See [xcode/Jasonette/Logger/README.md](xcode/Jasonette/Logger/README.md) For more details.

- Added `JasonNetworking.h` to enable configuring `AFHTTPSessionManager` and `AFJSONResponseSerializer`.

- Docs on how to implement extensions.

- Added [`uncrustify`](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/) config for code style standarization.

- Added new option in `href` to load a `web` with `reader mode`.
Based on the code by `@seletz`.

```json
{
    "options": {
        "reader": true
    }
}
```

- Added `$orientation` system event
that triggers when the orientation changes.

- Added `$env.view.params` variable that holds the query params inside the url.
Example `https://example.com?param1=1&params2=true`. Will show `param1` and `param2` as properties inside the params dictionary.

- Added `$agent.logger` to `agent.js` that can call the system logger.
Methods: `$agent.logger.log`, `$agent.logger.debug`, `$agent.logger.info`, `$agent.logger.warn`, `$agent.logger.error`. As replacements of `console.log` methods for webviews. 

### Changed

- Bumped to minimum iOS version `9.0`.

- Improved `JasonComponentFactory.h` to take in consideration `Swift` extensions.

- Establish `AppDelegate.h` as main *App Delegate* instead of `JasonAppDelegate.h`. The later will serve as a wrapper.

- Improved Code Organization.

- Improved Networking Code.

### Fixed

- Fixed Crash on parsing local json files with wrong syntax.

- Fixed Crash when no `$jason` property is present in json.

- Fixed Crash when url contained html content in a json expected return.

- Fixed Blank Screen when no `url` is found in `settings.plist`.

- Fixed Blank Screen if you click a `Tab Item` more than once.

- Fixed `WKWebView` orientation change not working. Based on the code by `@ricardojlpinto`.

- Fixed Crash when using`$vision` on simulator.

- Fixed not finding class when using non standard naming in extensions (now searches in lowercase too).

- Fixed Crash in iOS 10 when using webcontainers. It crashed because before iOS 11 the observers to notifications does not autorelease. Solved using `INTUAutoRemoveObserver`.

- Fixed Random Crash. The property `styles` in `JasonViewController` was not initialized
in some use cases. Now is lazy allocated
to prevent random crashes.
