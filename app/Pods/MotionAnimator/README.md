## MotionAnimator: a drop-in replacement

UIView's implicit animation APIs are also available on the MotionAnimator:

```swift
// Animating implicitly with UIView APIs
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5
})

// Equivalent MotionAnimator API
MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5
})
```

But the MotionAnimator allows you to animate more properties â€” and on more iOS versions:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  view.layer.cornerRadius = 10 // Only works on iOS 11 and up
})

MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  view.layer.cornerRadius = 10 // Works on iOS 8 and up
})
```

MotionAnimator makes use of the [MotionInterchange](https://github.com/material-motion/motion-interchange-objc), a standardized format for representing animation traits. This makes it possible to tweak the traits of an animation without rewriting the code that ultimately creates the animation, useful for building tweaking tools and making motion "stylesheets".

```swift
// Want to change a trait of your animation? You'll need to use a different function altogether
// to do so:
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5
})
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, delay: 0.5, options: [], animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5
}, completion: nil)

// But with the MotionInterchange, you can create and manipulate the traits of an animation
// separately from its execution.
let traits = MDMAnimationTraits(duration: 1.0)
traits.delay = 0.5

let animator = MotionAnimator()
animator.animate(with: traits, animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5
})
```

The MotionAnimator can also be used to replace explicit Core Animation code with additive explicit animations:

```swift
let from = 0
let to = 10
// Animating expicitly with Core Animation APIs
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "cornerRadius")
animation.fromValue = (from - to)
animation.toValue = 0
animation.isAdditive = true
animation.duration = 1.0
view.layer.add(animation, forKey: animation.keyPath)
view.layer.cornerRadius = to

// Equivalent implicit MotionAnimator API. cornerRadius will be animated additively by default.
view.layer.cornerRadius = 0
MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 1, animations: {
  view.layer.cornerRadius = 10
})

// Equivalent explicit MotionAnimator API
// Note that this API will also set the final animation value to the layer's model layer, similar
// to how implicit animations work, and unlike the explicit pure Core Animation implementation
// above.
let animator = MotionAnimator()
animator.animate(with: MDMAnimationTraits(duration: 1.0),
                 between: [0, 10],
                 layer: view.layer,
                 keyPath: .cornerRadius)
```

Springs on iOS require an initial velocity that's normalized by the displacement of the animation. MotionAnimator calculates this for you so that you can directly provide gesture recognizer velocity values:

```swift
// Common variables
let gestureYVelocity = gestureRecognizer.velocity(in: someContainerView).y
let destinationY = 75

// Animating springs implicitly with UIView APIs
let displacement = destinationY - view.position.y
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0,
               delay: 0,
               usingSpringWithDamping: 1.0,
               initialSpringVelocity: gestureYVelocity / displacement,
               options: [],
               animations: {
                 view.layer.position = CGPoint(x: view.position.x, y: destinationY)
               },
               completion: nil)

// Equivalent MotionAnimator API
let animator = MotionAnimator()
let traits = MDMAnimationTraits(duration: 1.0)
traits.timingCurve = MDMSpringTimingCurveGenerator(duration: traits.duration,
                                                   dampingRatio: 1.0,
                                                   initialVelocity: gestureYVelocity)
animator.animate(with: traits,
                 between: [view.layer.position.y, destinationY],
                 layer: view.layer,
                 keyPath: .y)
```

## Main thread animations vs Core Animation

Animation systems on iOS can be split into two general categories: main thread-based and Core Animation.

**Main thread**-based animation systems include UIDynamics, Facebook's [POP](https://github.com/facebook/pop), or anything driven by a CADisplayLink. These animation systems share CPU time with your app's main thread, meaning they're sharing resources with UIKit, text rendering, and any other main-thread bound processes. This also means the animations are subject to *main thread jank*, in other words: dropped frames of animation or "stuttering".

**Core Animation** makes use of the *render server*, an operating system-wide process for animations on iOS. This independence from an app's process allows the render server to avoid main thread jank altogether.

The primary benefit of main thread animations over Core Animation is that Core Animation's list of animatable properties is small and unchangeable, while main thread animations can animate anything in your application. A good example of this is using POP to animate a "time" property, and to map that time to the hands of a clock. This type of behavior cannot be implemented in Core Animation without moving code out of the render server and in to the main thread.

The primary benefit of Core Animation over main thread animations, on the other hand, is that your animations will be much less likely to drop frames simply because your app is busy on its main thread.

When evaluating whether to use a main thread-based animation system or not, check first whether the same animations can be performed in Core Animation instead. If they can, you may be able to offload the animations from your app's main thread by using Core Animation, saving you valuable processing time for other main thread-bound operations.

MotionAnimator is a purely Core Animation-based animator. If you are looking for main thread solutions then check out the following technologies:

There are two primary ways to animate with Core Animation on iOS:

1. **implicitly**, with the UIView `animateWithDuration:` APIs, or by setting properties on standalone CALayer instances (those that are **not** backing a UIView), and
2. **explicitly**, with the CALayer `addAnimation:forKey:` APIs.

A subset of UIView's and CALayer's public APIs is animatable by Core Animation. Of these animatable properties, some are implicitly animatable while some are not. Whether a property is animatable or not depends on the context within which it's being animated, and whether an animation is additive or not depends on which animation API is being used. With this matrix of conditions it's understandable that it can sometimes be difficult to know how to effectively make use of Core Animation.

The following quiz helps illustrate that the UIKit and Core Animation APIs can often lead to unintuitive behavior. Try to guess which of the following snippets will generate an animation and, if they do, what the generated animation's duration will be:

```

<details>
  <summary>Click to see the answer</summary>
  Generates an animation with duration of 0.25. This isn't a typo: standalone layers read from the current CATransaction rather than UIView's parameters when implicitly animating, even when the change happens within a UIView animation block.

### What properties can be explicitly animated?

For a full list of animatable CALayer properties, see the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/AnimatableProperties/AnimatableProperties.html).

MotionAnimator's explicit APIs can be used to animate any property that is animatable by Core Animation.

### What properties can be implicitly animated?

UIKit and Core Animation have different rules about when and how a property can be implicitly animated.

UIView properties generate implicit animations **only** when they are changed within an `animateWithDuration:` animation block.

CALayer properties generate implicit animations **only** when they are changed under either of the following conditions:

1. if the CALayer is backing a UIView, the CALayer property is a supported implicitly animatable property (this is not documented anywhere), and the property is changed within an `animateWithDuration:` block, or
2. if: the CALayer is **not** backing a UIView (an "unhosted layer"), the layer has been around for at least one CATransaction flush â€” either by invoking `CATransaction.flush()` or by letting the run loop pump at least once â€” and the property is changed at all.

This behavior can be somewhat difficult to reason through, most notably when trying to animate CALayer properties using the UIView `animateWithDuration:` APIs. For example, CALayer's cornerRadius was not animatable using `animateWithDuration:` up until iOS 11, and many other CALayer properties are still not implicitly animatable.

```swift
// This doesn't work until iOS 11.
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  view.layer.borderWidth = 10
}, completion: nil)

// This works all the way back to iOS 8.
MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  view.layer.borderWidth = 10
}, completion: nil)
```

The MotionAnimator provides a more consistent implicit animation API with a well-defined set of supported properties.

### In general, when will changing a property cause an implicit animation?

The following charts describe when changing a property on a given object will cause an implicit animation to be generated.

#### UIView

```swift
let view = UIView()

// inside animation block
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5 // Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.8
})

// outside animation block
view.alpha = 0.5 // Will not animate

// inside MotionAnimator animation block
MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  view.alpha = 0.5 // Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.8
})
```

| UIVIew key path        | inside animation block | outside animation block | inside MotionAnimator animation block |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| `alpha`                | âœ“                      |                         | âœ“                                     |

| `bounds`               | âœ“                      |                         | âœ“                                     |

#### Backing CALayer

Every UIView has a backing CALayer.

```swift
let view = UIView()

// inside animation block
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  view.layer.opacity = 0.5 // Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.8
})

// outside animation block
view.layer.opacity = 0.5 // Will not animate

// inside MotionAnimator animation block
MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  view.layer.opacity = 0.5 // Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.8
})
```

| CALayer key path               | inside animation block | outside animation block | inside MotionAnimator animation block |
|:-------------------------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| `anchorPoint`                  | âœ“ (starting in iOS 11) |                         | âœ“                                     |
| `backgroundColor`              |                        |                         | âœ“                                     |
| `bounds`                       | âœ“                      |                         | âœ“                                     |
| `borderWidth`                  |                        |                         | âœ“                                     |

#### Unflushed, unhosted CALayer

CALayers are unflushed until the next `CATransaction.flush()` invocation, which can happen either directly or at the end of the current run loop.

```swift
let layer = CALayer()

// inside animation block
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  layer.opacity = 0.5 // Will not animate
})

// outside animation block
layer.opacity = 0.5 // Will not animate

// inside MotionAnimator animation block
MotionAnimator.animate(withDuration: 0.8, animations: {
  layer.opacity = 0.5 // Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.8
})
```

#### Flushed, unhosted CALayer

```swift

// It's usually unnecessary to flush the transaction, unless you want to be able to implicitly
// animate it without using a MotionAnimator.
CATransaction.flush()

// inside animation block

  // Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.25 because it uses the CATransaction duration
  // rather than the UIKit duration.
  layer.opacity = 0.5
})

// outside animation block
// Will generate an animation with a duration of 0.25
layer.opacity = 0.5

// inside MotionAnimator animation block

## Example apps/unit tests

Check out a local copy of the repo to access the Catalog application by running the following
commands:

    git clone https://github.com/material-motion/motion-animator-objc.git
    cd motion-animator-objc
    pod install
    open MotionAnimator.xcworkspace

## Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

> CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift libraries. CocoaPods automates the
> process of using third-party libraries in your projects. See
> [the Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for more
> information. You can install it with the following command:
>
>     gem install cocoapods

Add `motion-animator` to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'MotionAnimator'

Then run the following command:

    pod install

### Usage

Import the framework:

    @import MotionAnimator;

You will now have access to all of the APIs.
