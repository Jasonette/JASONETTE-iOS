 Block-Based Reachability Observation, using the SystemConfiguration.framework.

Modified to use `SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithName` instead based on Nick Lockwoods [FXReachability](http://github.com/nicklockwood/FXReachability) because this approach also takes the DNS resolvability into consideration.
 
 A shared instance is provided via +defaultReachability which is configured to check reachability of apple.com. Custom reachability manager instances can be configure to monitor reachability of custom host names.
