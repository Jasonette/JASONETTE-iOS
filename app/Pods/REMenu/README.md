## Requirements
* Xcode 5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 6.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `REMenuExample` project in Xcode to see `REMenu` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `REMenu` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.28.0** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add REMenu:

``` bash
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'REMenu', '~> 1.10'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `REMenu` files into your project, and add `#include "REMenu.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
REMenuItem *homeItem = [[REMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Home"
                                                  subtitle:@"Return to Home Screen"
                                                     image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon_Home"]
                                          highlightedImage:nil
                                                    action:^(REMenuItem *item) {
                                                        NSLog(@"Item: %@", item);
                                                    }];

REMenuItem *exploreItem = [[REMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Explore"
                                                   subtitle:@"Explore 47 additional options"
                                                      image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon_Explore"]
                                           highlightedImage:nil
                                                     action:^(REMenuItem *item) {
                                                         NSLog(@"Item: %@", item);
                                                     }];

REMenuItem *activityItem = [[REMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Activity"
                                                    subtitle:@"Perform 3 additional activities"
                                                       image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon_Activity"]
                                            highlightedImage:nil
                                                      action:^(REMenuItem *item) {
                                                          NSLog(@"Item: %@", item);
                                                      }];

REMenuItem *profileItem = [[REMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Profile"
                                                      image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon_Profile"]
                                           highlightedImage:nil
                                                     action:^(REMenuItem *item) {
                                                         NSLog(@"Item: %@", item);
                                                     }];

self.menu = [[REMenu alloc] initWithItems:@[homeItem, exploreItem, activityItem, profileItem]];
[self.menu showFromNavigationController:self.navigationController];
```

You can also present `REMenu` from a custom view, there are 2 specific tasks for that:

``` objective-c
- (void)showFromRect:(CGRect)rect inView:(UIView *)view;
- (void)showInView:(UIView *)view;
```

Since version 1.3 you are able to assign custom view to your items, as show below:

``` objective-c
UIView *customView = [[UIView alloc] init];
customView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];
customView.alpha = 0.4;
REMenuItem *customViewItem = [[REMenuItem alloc] initWithCustomView:customView action:^(REMenuItem *item) {
    NSLog(@"Tap on customView");
}];
```
