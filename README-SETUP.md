## HOW TO SETUP

- do "pod install" (podfile was updated; added GCDWebServer)
- open in Jasonette.xcworkspace
- drag folder \Jasonette\webroot to Xcode under Jasonette
- run
- href/urls that has *http://local.web* will be changed to _http://198.X.X:8080/_ so that url resolves to the running webserver
- the settings.plist was updated to use *http://local.web/hello.json*
