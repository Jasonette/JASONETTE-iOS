/**
 This method allows the caller to specify particular values for many different parameters such
 as scheme, method, header values and alternate signature hash algorithms.

 @p scheme may be any string value, generally "http" or "https".
 @p requestMethod may be any string value. There is no validation, so remember that all
 currently-defined HTTP methods are uppercase and the RFC specifies that the method
 is case-sensitive.
 @p dataEncoding allows for the transmission of data as either URL-encoded form data or
 JSON by passing the value TDOAuthContentTypeUrlEncodedForm or TDOAuthContentTypeJsonObject.
 This parameter is ignored for the requestMethod "GET".
 @p headerValues accepts a hash of key-value pairs (both must be strings) that specify
 HTTP header values to be included in the resulting URL Request. For example, the argument
 value @{@"Accept": @"application/json"} will include the header to indicate the server
 should respond with JSON. Other values are acceptable, depending on the server, but be
 careful. Values you supply will override the defaults which are set for User-Agent
 (set to "app-bundle-name/version" your app resources), Accept-Encoding (set to "gzip")
 and the calculated Authentication header. Attempting to specify the latter will be fatal.
 You should also avoid passing in values for the Content-Type and Content-Length header fields.
 @p signatureMethod accepts an enum and should normally be set to TDOAuthSignatureMethodHmacSha1.
 You have the option of using HMAC-SHA256 by setting this parameter to
 TDOAuthSignatureMethodHmacSha256; this is not included in the RFC for OAuth 1.0a, so most servers
 will not support it.

  OAuth Echo example (we have found that some consumers require HTTPS for the
  echo, so to be safe we always do it):

    NSMutableURLRequest *rq = [NSMutableURLRequest new];
    [rq setValue:[[echo URL] absoluteString] forHTTPHeaderField:@"X-Auth-Service-Provider"];
    [rq setValue:[echo valueForHTTPHeaderField:@"Authorization"] forHTTPHeaderField:@"X-Verify-Credentials-Authorization"];
    // Now consume rq with an NSURLConnection
    [rq release];

/**
  Suggested usage would be to make some categories for this class that
  automatically adds both secrets, both tokens and host information. This
  makes usage less cumbersome. Eg:

      [TwitterOAuth GET:@"/1/statuses/home_timeline.json"];
      [TwitterOAuth GET:@"/1/statuses/home_timeline.json" queryParameters:dictionary];

  At TweetDeck we have TDAccount classes that represent separate user logins
  for different services when instantiated.
